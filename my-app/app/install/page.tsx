        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight py-5">How it works</h1>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">iPhones don't support easily theming home screens like Android; however,using a mixture of pictures and shortcuts, users can still create a custom iOS home screen.</p>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">This is time consuming because it requires curating custom icon pictures, a matching background, and creating shortcuts for the custom app icons. This is made further complex because iOS slightly adjusts background and dock colors based on device theme and accessibility settings. I've created this project to make the custom icon process easier.</p>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">To make this work, you'll need to make sure both the Shortcuts and Files apps are downloaded on your iPhone.</p>

        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight py-5">Get your icons, background, and shortcuts</h1>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">Visit the <a href="/" className="underline">Home screen</a>, choose a color, and download. Save this file in your Files app. Tap on the .zip download in the Files app to extract all the files to a folder. This file packages everything you need into one folder.</p>

        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight py-5">Set your background</h1>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">Enter the folder you just extracted and open the 'background' file. Press the share button and choose 'Save Image'. Then set this image as your wallpaper from the iOS 'Photos' app.</p>

        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight py-5">Set up each icon</h1>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">The following steps will need to be done for each icon you want to add to your home screen.</p>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">1. Grab the shortcut from the folder you extracted for the app you want to add to your home screen.</p>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">Go to the 'shortcuts' folder. Tap the shortcut for the app you need and press 'Add Shortcut'.</p>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">2. Add the shortcut to your home screen.</p>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">Tap the three dots in the top right of the shortcut. Press the arrow next to the shortcut name and choose 'Add to Home Screen'. Press the icon next to the name of the shortcut and select 'Choose File'. Navigate to the folder you extracted.</p>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">You'll find the picture for your icon in one of three folders:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>wallpaper_icons</strong>: If this app is going to be placed on your home screen but not on the dock.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>dark_dock_icons</strong>: If this app is going to be placed on your dock and you use the 'dark' system theme.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>light_dock_icons</strong>: If this app is going to be placed on your dock and you use the 'light' system theme.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">
        Enter the corresponding folder, and choose the icon for your app (the search bar can help you find this quicker). If you'd like to remove the words under the app icon, press the 'X' next to the app icon name.</p>
        <p className="tracking-tight py-3">
        Press 'Add' in the upper right corner. This icon is now on your home screen! Repeat this step for all your apps.</p>
